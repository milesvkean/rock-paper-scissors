# rock-paper-scissors

# hi i am going to learn how to make a game and a computer player that generates random choices
want it to say "let's play rock paper scissors! enter your selection:" in a pop up
then next alert will display computer choice and user choice and say who won (nothing mentioning game 1)
want it to say round 1/5 etc.

still need:
incorrect strings need to not count, prompt to enter valid selection
need to display the results

finally figure out how to show final score on the main screen

those were all notes to self

i want to figure out how to show the results and have them display on the webpage
but for now i am logging them to the console like the directions said
think i did everything the way i'm supposed to
i learned a lot like i had an issue where the score was kept within the loop
and so it only ever went to 1 then started over
put that outside the for loop and it worked fine
